"Two things can be true at once.  We can dislike the fact that the Russians hacked an American political party's emails and we can also recognize that the Democrats defeat likely had very little to do with that hack.  The Democrats were asking for trouble in the setup of their servers and their two-faced approach to politics.  It confirmed that the Democrats were everything that we knew them to be but we shouldn't be fooled into aligning ourselves with a horrible person like Putin.

The fact is that Putin is a bad guy - he isn't our friend.  He in no way represents conservative values or has any love for the US.  He has taken advantage of the last two presidents' desire to have a cordial relationship.  We're mistaken if we think that just because he didn't like Hillary that he will work with President Trump.  

If Trump really means ""America first"", then let's have an investigation.  Let's find out what the Russians did to an American institution.  However, we can also say that the Democrats lost not because of the hacked emails; they lost because they had a horrible candidate.  We should rejoice in the fact they are still making excuses for those terrible decisions because it means they're likely to make them again in the future.  I hope they double-down on identity politics and SJWs so that they receive another ass-kicking in the future.",conservative

"I appreciate this, I try not to be an asshole where possible. But survey data of Trump supporters have definitely seen large numbers of racism among the conservative party. We Democrats have some soul searching to do as a party right now, but I still believe that we aren't alone in that. Frankly, racism, regardless of political affiliation is deplorable and should be spoken out against, but the term can't be liberally applied to mean ""anyone who voted against my candidate"". 

I'm sorry if that's happened to you unfairly. This was a divisive election. Let's be honest, we Democrats overlooked an enormous amount of scandals from Hillary Clinton because we were so terrified of a Trump election. Exit polling shows that Conservatives did the same thing in reverse. Whatever happened this election can't happen again. We can't have candidates that are so deeply divisive that the other party fears for the future of their country. I don't believe all Trump supporters are racist. I don't believe that most of them are racist. I recognize that many were utterly terrified at the prospect of a Clinton presidency. But even though we have our own work to do over the next few years, I hope that the majority of conservatives in your party who are decent people will speak out against racists within your party.

It references the above NY Times article.  

About her the book states: ""'One investigator says, ""I couldn't believe this girl who was so intelligent and nice looking could be so unemotional about what she was telling me she and her friends had done.  They'd squeezed the victim's testicles with a pair of pliers, beat him, burned him.  Actually, I thought the judge's sentence was lenient.'""

The mikeroweWORKS Foundation is a 501(c)(3) public charity that rewards people with a passion to get trained for skilled jobs that actually exist. As CEO of the Foundation, Mike Rowe spends a significant amount of time speaking about the country’s dysfunctional relationship with work, highlighting the widening skills gap, and challenging the persistent belief that a four-year degree is automatically the best path for the most people.  

Through its scholarship programs, including the Work Ethic Scholarship Program, the Foundation provides financial assistance to qualified individuals with a desire to learn a skill that is in demand. The Foundation has been instrumental in granting more than $3 million in education for trade schools across the country.

"I like Mike Rowe. But this quote is absurd, and hypocritical of him if it's true. He's the biggest supporter of trade tech jobs, many of which require years of training at no tiny expense.

Sure it's a bit cheaper than a university degree, but the earning potential of the degree is 10x that of the trade tech certificate.

Yes we should encourage kids to do ""dirty jobs"" and we should pay better for the ones that can't be automated (yet).

I don't care what people believe. What people say to themselves in their own head has no effect on me or anyone else. When those thoughts turn to action is when there's a problem. And in Islam those thoughts turn to action pretty frequently.,conservative
"ITT are people who don't know Muslims and haven't been to Muslim countries.

Islam has its problems and quite frankly could use a reformation that purges the Saudi school of thought but Muslims are people just like you and me and are mostly great.  There are assholes from all religions.  People who misinterpret the Bible, Torah, and Koran.  One of the bigger realizations for me through my travels was how we mostly see the world through stereotypes and how different it really is when you get there and meet people.  No, all Americans are not fat and stupid, Colombians aren't all drug dealing, and Muslims aren't all terrorists.  In fact very few of them are and the Muslim world is suffering terribly at the hands of fundamentalism and would love to get rid of them.  How do you as a normal Syrian, Egyptian, or Iraqi get rid of them though?  How do I get rid of crazy Christian terrorists back home?  The answer is I can't since I don't know any and am just at the mercy of their craziness when they go and blow up an abortion clinic.

Let's not paint with such a broad brush.  If you do, you could use a trip to a Muslim country to get a reality check.  It might not be the religion for you but you'll find that most Muslims, like most people from all religions, are nice people who aren't going to kill you.",conservative

"I'm a libertarian-leaning American conservative, and I can't find anything that I disagree with in your post. And by that I mean that I am for the things you are for, and against the things you are against.  My sincere hope is that you do not believe that the majority of conservatives are the opposite of me.

I am for:

1) Equal rights for all, regardless of any adjective that may be applied to an individual, external or internal.  This also means that all individuals are equal before the law, having 'protected classes' makes them 'more equal', which breeds contempt for these groups, trying to make up for past wrongs with the force of government always backfires.

2) Freedom of speech, especially speech I don't like.  Hearing dissent provokes me to re-examine what I believe, and if that is never done, terrible things can happen.

3) Peaceful protest, which is an extension of free speech. 

4) Freedom of religion, with the stipulation that religion and state must be strictly divided, intermixing the two, corrupts both. 

What I am against:

1) Division into groups. There is no such thing as a 'collective right' all rights are held by individuals. Of course these individuals have the freedom of association, to form groups, and exist as a collective, but these groups should never be allowed to infringe the rights of other individuals or groups of individuals.  I believe the identity politics that have become so prominent in today's political landscape are the new face of classism/racism/arbitrary-discrimination in the world.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I am personally against these things, and I seek out dissenting opinions, but in a free nation I see no way to compel others to do the same without infringing their rights.

3) Forcing any views on others. The thing I really like about the libertarians is their Non-Aggression Principle. It's their 'Occam's razor' to determine if something is compatible with libertarian principles, and it's extremely simple. Ask yourself the question ""Does this infringe the rights (particularly property rights as in most libertarian schools of thought, property rights are the basis of all rights) of any other individual or group?""

"15+ cop here. I got injuried while on an emergency call back in January.  I have been off work for over 6 months recovering from those injured.  Most of this time has been spent in bed.  I've been to many doctors and specialist and so on.  I'm currently in my second round of physical therapy.  I'm fighting very hard to get back to work, and I have no idea why.  When you spend hours laid up in bed, you watch a lot of TV.  I've watched the Dallas coverage for hours and now the Baton Rouge coverage all day.  I have felt such anger over over both these unwarranted slaughtering of police offers.  But my anger didn't start with just these 2 attracts.  Last September I spent 11 hours in the darkness in the middle of nowhere searching for a man named Joseph Thomas Johnson-Shanks.  He was a black lives matter activist that you probably never heard of.  He was better known in the black lives matter community as ""Jay Milehigh"".  He was pulled over for speeding on the evening of September 13th, 2015 by Kentucky State Police Trooper Cameron Ponder.  During the stop Trp. Cameron realized that his license was expired.  Trp. Cameron didn't want to arrest him because Shanks had his family was with him, including 2 kids.  Trp. Cameron went back to his cruiser and on his own began talking to his dispatcher about trying to find a hotel in the area that Shanks could stay.  This is not policy.  It's just something nice he was trying to do for Shanks until he could get a ride home from someone.   Trp. Ponder could not legally allow him to drive and he didn't want to leave him and his family on the side of the interstate.  Despite all his good work and kindness in assisting Shanks, Trp. Ponder would be dead in just a few minutes.  Shanks opened fire on Trp. Ponder as he sat in his police car.  Shooting at him 9 times through the front windshield. Trp. Ponder was never able to even draw his gun from his holster.  He was able to tell the dispatcher that he had been shot and that he was losing consciousness.  That was his last words.  Shanks abandoned his family like the coward he was and fled into the woods.  I had just seen Trp. Ponder the previous night at a safety checkpoint.  He had only been a police office 9 months. 

11 hours later Shanks was found high up in tree with his gun out apparently waiting to ambush approaching officers.  He was spotted and ordered to drop his weapon which he did not.  That was a battle he shouldn't have fought. He was shot twice and killed.  

Police work is something that I love.  I've devoted my life to it.  Being someone that somebody calls on to help them is a privilege that I've never taken lightly.  But I feel the pride turning into concern.  I have a family and kids at home.  Am I being selfish doing something I love that puts me in grave risk?  I dunno.  I know monetarily it's not worth it.  My wife's a teachers aid who works with the mentally handicapped.  We make barely enough money to scrape by.  We can't even afford vacations away from this madness, and haven't so much as been 20 miles out of town as a family in years.  And now the very uniform that I've worn with pride for 15 years has went from becoming a symbol of professionalism, to being a target.

I'm sorry for all this rambling Reddit.  I just needed to talk to someone, even though I have no idea who you are.  For the first time I think I don't want to be a cop anymore.  And that's what scares me. I'm sharing this with you because Reddit is a place of comfort to me.  I see the worst in people all day long, but at the end of the day you guys make me laugh.  And that helps me get to the next day.  So thanks for that and letting me vent.  

My thoughts and prayers are very focused on this hero, the other officers shot and killed, and their families and the rest of the police, sheriff, state and other departments of Baton Rouge.

Edit: appending my reply to a comment to this post to address the disturbing amount of transphobia going on in these comments

---------
Gender dysphoria is an actual condition. Those affected by it are legitimately and fundamentally uncomfortable in their own body. Directly treating the brain is not possible at this point in time and direct therapy sessions don't massively help the person feel more okay in their body. Reassignment surgery, on the other hand, helps transgender individuals feel a lot better in their own bodies. If we could solve this discomfort without body modification that'd be obviously preferable but we can't.

Being transgender can be proven, through neurological and physiological analysis, to be something that is an inherent part of those who identify with it. It's not like everyone who feels a little feminine is getting hormone injections.

 **They're still people.** Calling them ""it"" and obsessing over the fucking bathroom shit dehumanizes them and helps breed the kind of societal attitude that produces anti-transgender hate crimes. Just treat them like people. They're not going into their identified gender's bathroom to creep on or rape people. They're there to piss or take a shit.

The biological girl that was a transsexual wanting to be a boy won so easily because she/he was on testosterone hormones as part of their hormone treatment to become more boyish.

"I know I'm late to the party, but I see too many people using this comparison and from a legal standpoint, it doesn't make any sense. If anyone is actually interested in knowing why the judicial responses were different: 

Under Obama, the statute in question was Title IX, which says that schools may not discriminate on the basis of sex, except for matters such as separate bathrooms, locker rooms, sports teams, etc. The statute does not define ""sex"" so the Department of Education issued a regulation stating that, in the Department's opinion, sex refers to one's gender identity. Under the precedent set by Chevron v. NRDC, when an executive agency is charged with implementing a statute, they may issue their rules in any way that reasonably complies with the statute. The term ""Chevron Deference"" arose because the standard is very deferential. Thus, the Department of Education thought it was reasonable to interpret the word ""sex"" as ""gender identity"" so they issued the regulation. The Eastern District of Virginia disagreed and issued an injunction against that interpretation. The Fourth Circuit reversed and ruled that Chevron required them to respect the Department of Education's interpretation. The Supreme Court never heard the case because Trump withdrew the interpretation. 

tl;dr for Obama. It was an administrative interpretation, which is subject to a high level of deference. 

For Trump, there was no administrative interpretation. It was simply an executive order that said that no cities will receive any federal funding not mandated by law if they continue to act as ""sanctuary jurisdictions."" Here's the problem: The Order did not specify which statutes would be cut, which any reasonable judge would find to be unconstitutionally vague. The Order created spending limitations not specified by Congress, which violates the separation of powers by infringing on Congress's Spending Power and bypassing the requirements the Supreme Court made in South Dakota v. Dole for conditional spending. 

tl;dr for Trump: He issued his order in a vague way that exceeded his constitutional powers as Executive. In this instance, because he has no statute to re-interpret in a beneficial way, he must go through Congress. 

For anyone curious, I'm pretty much as central politically as it gets. Most of my friends think I'm a hardcore conservative because I don't parrot the democrat party line. I really tried to make that analysis as neutral as possible. 

tl;dr for the whole post: Trump and Obama were operating under fundamentally different legal structures and the judge was correct to block the order. Congress is welcome to write a statute that will accomplish Trump's goals, but he may not do it himself.

Here there's not much media opposition to the US MSM, since they are affairs of the US and so there's not much interest to put a debate around it. Also I find that our MSM here are either in association with MSM in the US, or don't care much about it.

So my advice is that if Conservatives could manage to focus solely on the words LEGAL and ILLEGAL immigration, it'd be a yuuge win against the media, since they purposely lose those words in the debate.

Carlos Slim already came out to say that Trump isn't a threat, and that we should expect him to be a great president, for example.

As far as I can see, Liberals are only making straw-man arguments (the same with voter ID saying it's racist) so if you can focus on actual reality instead of their alternate reality, it'd be a much easier task, I think.",conservative

"I think you can go about this several ways, in regards to Bill Nye. It somewhat depends on your perspective. Here are four different definitions of what makes a scientist that I've seen most often.

1.) Scientists are people who actively seek to acquire knowledge about the world, use this knowledge to make predictions, and do it in a logical and systematic fashion. Under this most broad and underlying definition, everyone is scientist in some regards, starting this quest for knowledge as young children.

2.) Being a scientist is a profession. You need a specific degree in a specific field to be considered a scientist (Physicist, Biologist, Geologist, Experimental Psychologist). This category is somewhat arbitrary, as many people with degrees not immediately thought of as science (Pharmacists for example) do engage in research and publication of research, and there are some who don't count the social sciences within the category of a ""true"" scientist because of the subject matter involved.

3.) Being a scientist means that you actively engage in research and publication, in a peer-reviewed, logical and systematic fashion. Regardless of profession.

4.) Being a scientist means that you have a firm grasp of the theoretical foundation of your field, and have comprehensive knowledge about current and past research, which you apply in your profession or your daily life. This category includes those who apply the research in their field but don't publish, but who work in a profession requiring extensive background and knowledge of scientific principles.

Bill Nye falls under the category of scientist depending on how you classify it. However I think it's important to note that I don't think that he ever claimed to be a scientist in the sense that he was conducting and publishing research papers within a certain field. He doesn't insist on people calling him ""Doctor"". He has never been deceitful or evasive about what degrees he holds either, as far as my understanding goes.

"Now I know I am gonna probably disagree with a lot of folks on this subject, but I want to bring it to you respectfully. Read this passage:

>In April 2006, police records show Hodgkinson went to a neighbor’s house looking for his daughter and “used bodily force to damage” a wooden door upstairs. Witnesses said Hodgkinson forced his way into the home looking for his teenage daughter and grabbed her by the hair when he found her upstairs, according to a police narrative on file with St. Clair County Sheriff’s Department.

>His daughter escaped and got into the neighbor’s car, but Hodgkinson opened the door of the car, pulled out a pocket knife and cut off the seat belt she was wearing, records show. Hodgkinson’s wife joined him, struggling to pull out their daughter, as Hodgkinson punched the neighbor who was in the driver’s seat of the car in the face, witnesses told police.

>Later, Joel Fernandez, the boyfriend of the woman who was punched, went to Hodgkinson’s home to confront him. He said Hodgkinson “walked outside with a shotgun and aimed it at Fernandez face,” a complaint states. Hodgkinson struck Fernandez on the side of his face with the wooden stock of the shotgun and fired off one round as Fernandez ran away.

>Police arrested Hodgkinson and his wife and charged them with domestic battery and aggravated discharge of a firearm, according to a narrative obtained by The Washington Post. Police also recovered a 12-gauge shotgun. The county clerk’s online database shows the charges were later dismissed.

Now, yes the charges were dismissed, but my concern is that this man, who has a violent past and obviously has severe mental issues apparent by the fact that he is attempting to murder US Congressmen based on political ideology, has a gun. 

Now, due process shouldn't have been circumvented in not allowing him to own a gun, but any background check into this man would have raised a red flag and a proper investigation into whether this man should be allowed to carry could've been conducted. This is the common sense that we should all be working together towards.

"It's pretty simple to answer that question from a technical perspective, which after all is what it purports to be seeking.  In medicine and psychiatry, a disorder needs to be something that is damaging to health or disrupts the ability to function in society.  Anorexia obviously is harmful to a person.  Whether transgenderism is harmful is obviously debatable.

One female to male I know is even transitioning back to female because of this realization.

"As a physician this is an interesting talking point, but really it does miss the boat a bit. 

Anorexia is an eating disorder based on AN EXTREME FEAR of eating good and gaining wait, and has some ties in the body dysmorphic realm but not really.

Gender is most often described in the social construct, while sex is for biologic.  What is interesting is we have sexually dimorphic nuclei in the brain that are determined largely by exposure to hormones in utero. Because of this there will always be a spectrum of sexuality as far as what people are attracted to with the large portion of the population hetero. Because there is a structural neurologic basis to this it is not the same as anorexia, and can't be addressed the same way, I.e. Intensive therapy. And really it's very ignorant to think so.  As far as how society handles it and this large group of people that basically make up makes to define their sexuality, that's a bit absurd, is an individual thing and probably shouldn't be the lingo in policy.

"> Anorexia is the most lethal psychiatric disorder, carrying a sixfold increased risk of death -- four times the death risk from major depression.

If a transgender faces any sort of harassment, is ridiculed by friends and family, has a harder time finding a job, etc. then that increases the chance of depression and overall dissatisfaction with life.

The title of the study is: The Rise and Nature of Alternative Work Arrangements in the United States, 1995-2015

* ""alternative work"" is defined as:
 * ""temporary help agency workers, on-call workers, contract workers, and independent
contractors or freelancers""

The study says that amount of ""alternative work"" has risen from 10.7% to 15.8% over the course of the study. 

The study also tracked ""gig"" jobs, defined as:

* Workers who provide services
through online intermediaries, such as Uber or Task Rabbit
 * Which accounts for .5% of all workers in 2015

"The question is, is that going to change?

I work in automation. Most people think my job is literally to destroy manufacturing jobs. That's not quite true. Automation doesn't destroy as many jobs as people think it does. For one, it employs people like *me* to write programs, start up machines, troubleshoot and repair them when things go wrong, etc. What automation does is not destroy jobs, it makes jobs *easier*, which means *less skills* are needed. 

Back in the 50s, in order to create a metal component with critical dimensions, you needed very skilled guys to make it. High skill = High Salaries = More expensive product. But with the advent of CNC machines, you can make the same parts very accurately, at a higher volume, using a low-skill worker. Any high school kid with 2 weeks of training can run a CNC mill. So now, low skill = lower salaries = cheaper product. This generates higher demand, possibly, but thanks to automation you can meet that demand without hiring anyone more.

Automation doesn't kill jobs as much as it turns skilled trade jobs into unskilled jobs. It takes the job of a skilled machine operator and turns it into something a child could do. Yes, somebody is still needed to press the buttons and hit ""start,"" but all they need to do now is press the buttons and hit ""start.""

My point is, I personally don't think this will change under Trump. Trump is not going to turn the clock back on automation. Companies don't want to do it. Automation is an inevitable force, and it will, eventually, make almost *all* jobs part-time or contract.",conservative

Back when the AA community had 70% nuclear family rate before the 1970s where it is upside down today.

1) I'm sick and tired of the SJW shrills, and Trump has some kind of glowing orange armor that renders him immune.  He remains alpha and based, never skipping a beat.  Today we are in a liberal version of the ""Red Scare"", where the word ""bigot"" replaces ""communist"" in ruining people's careers by mere suspicion or association.   No one else has tried to combat this on the right, and we wouldn't even be talking about illegal-immigration or all these issues were it not for Trump because of that culture of fear.

2) You can see how hard liberals in particular HATE America and push toward globalism.  Look at their favorite political talk-show hosts that they crow over, not a patriotic American, but a Brit and a South African that do nothing but disparage the United States and American culture for a laugh.  I'm sick and tired of this idea that the United States shouldn't act in self-interest, as it makes no sense to me.   I want America to do whats good for America.   I want an outspoken Nationalist.

3) People say he's narcissistic, but I think his ego is a wonderful thing.   He already has fame and he already has fortune, but what he lacks is legacy.   I believe that is his real ambition in his later years now, seeing his own mortality, that his ego wants to see him join the ranks of one of the few top leaders this young country has had, and have an aircraft carrier, interstate high-speed rail system, and wall named after him.   And this need to succeed to make that legacy stick will have him absolutely 110% dedicated to accomplishing those goals.

4) And speaking of rails and walls and the like, this is another thing I like about him.   He's a builder, he knows all about imminent domain, and he likes building big and bold.    I really would love to see national projects like a true big beautiful wall to define our country's border.   The Romans and Chinese in antiquity built glorious walls that lasted thousands of years, so why can't we with 2016 technology put those walls to shame?   Why can't we use our military power for defense for a change, just as the Romans did manning their walls at the peak of the empire's prosperity and size?    Why can't we have a national high speed rail system like Europe, China, and Japan connecting all our major cities?

"Yes, but -- and I realize this is going to make me sound like a liberal, rather than a conservative purist -- we live in a society where corporations have rights. Where the system is set up to make it difficult to achieve the level of independence that was once the hallmark of American life, especially for those whose circumstances lock them into negative situations. 

This system feeds itself. You can't grant unchecked privileges to corporations and expect them not to exploit those privileges, especially when we're talking about publicly traded companies that feel an obligation to increase profits. You don't have a ""right"" to government health insurance, but good luck finding realistically priced care without health insurance. For that matter, good luck finding realistically priced health insurance. 

Additionally, as healthcare advances, it gets more expensive. Your great-great-grandparents may have been diagnosed with late-stage cancer, called the doctor for morphine, and passed away. This would be the case for the wealthy as well as the poor because there weren't a barrage of sophisticated treatment options available. Is it just to deny these new treatments to poor people simply because they're poor (asking this seriously)? The founding fathers never dreamed of a day when a 3-hour procedure in a hospital would cost $10,000. 

You can't have it both ways. You can't take the means of success away from people and then expect them to thrive in a society where the odds are stacked against them. 

I would love to live in a country where people don't rely on government programs to support themselves for the long term. I would love to live in a place where healthcare is realistically affordable and no government programs are necessary.

I'm not necessarily a hard core conservative, I'm more of a conservative libertarian. Just for reference.

I don't deny the existence of climate change. I even agree that some of it has been caused by humans. Just for reference.

My problem with the movement is how it has become a vehicle for others to continually tell me how to live my life, and that even if I do what they say, it's never good enough.

I'm single, so it's easy for me to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle. I live in a small, energy efficient apartment. I drive the most eco friendly car I can for the area I live in. I recycle as much as I can and make every attempt to avoid non biodegradable materials and eat organic sustainable food.

Yet even after all of that, I am made to feel by the environmentalists that it's not enough. It will never be enough. Every day there is just another report on the front page of Reddit that tells how bad everything is and how we're still going to hell in a hand basket.

So, even though I grew up being brainwashed with all of the environmentalist talking points, and therefore integrating them into my life because I felt it was socially unacceptable to not do so, after thirty plus years, I feel that it will never be enough.

Some government agency or private environmentalist group will always find a way to tell me what I have to do next. To tell me that my lifestyle is still not ""good"" enough.

2. There was unlawful wiretapping to Trump tower: This is a really, really big deal and he needs to show a ton of evidence. He's implied in that lawyer tweet that Barack Obama should be brought to trial. If this is a Nixxon Watergate thing, remember it took months of investigatory journalism.

Now combine this with the shutting down of conservative speakers on college campuses, the riots in Berkeley, the pushing of narratives by people like Lena Dunham fantasizing about the extinction of the straight white male, the ongoing characterization of anyone who doesn't buy in completely with the leftist agenda as a Nazi.

>Like the changing of the tides, it was inevitable that Donald Trump would brazenly misrepresent himself in last night’s Republican presidential debate.

>Asked if about his plan to raise a tariff on imported Chinese goods to 45%, reported by the New York Times, Trump said, “That’s wrong. They were wrong. It’s the New York Times, they are always wrong.”

>The New York Times, always wrong or not, is equipped with audio recorders, and the paper quickly produced this transcript of Trump’s meeting with the newspaper’s editorial board:

>>I would tax China coming in—products coming in. I would do a tariff. And they do it to us. We have to be smart. I’m a free trader. I’m a free trader. And some of the people would say, ‘Oh, it’s terrible.’ I’m a free trader. I love free trade. But it’s got to be reasonably fair. I would do a tax, and the tax—let me tell you what the tax should be. The tax should be 45 percent.

>Trump concluded that if China continued what he sees as unfair trade practices, “I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China.”

I don't mean to change the subject from Trumps multinumerous lies but - I totally get what President Trump was articulating: that China has engaged in unfair practices. However,  there are both a dispute settlement process and sanctions that can be invoked through the WTO  which do not involve unilateral retailation and cause tariffs to escalate. We've done it before. It's been done to us (Boeing).

Basically, by lying at the debate, President Trump seriously misrepresented the anti-free trade nature of his candidacy and cheated every other Republican in the room.

"Downvote if you will, but keep in mind there are problems with this data. As /u/iamelben pointed out when this was posted to /r/economics, From the NYT article:
>The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, relied on reports filled out by police officers, and a set of police departments willing to share those reports. Recent videos of police shootings have led many to question the reliability of such accounts. But the results were largely the same whether or not Mr. Fryer used information from narratives provided by officers.

From the NBER paper itself:
>Our results have several important caveats. First, all but one dataset was provided by a select group of police departments. It is possible that these departments only supplied the data because they are either enlightened or were not concerned about what the analysis would reveal. In essence, this is equivalent to analyzing labor market discrimination on a set of firms willing to supply a researcher with their Human Resources data! There may be important selection in who was willing to share their data. The Police-Public contact survey partially sidesteps this issue by including a nationally representative sample of civilians, but it does not contain data on officer-involved shootings.",conservative
">In officer-involved shootings in these 10 cities, officers were more likely to fire their weapons without having first been attacked when the suspects were white. Black and white civilians involved in police shootings were equally likely to have been carrying a weapon. Both of these results undercut the idea that the police wield lethal force with racial bias.

>However, for Mr. Fryer, who has spent much of his career studying ways society can close the racial achievement gap, **the failure to punish excessive everyday force is an important contributor to young black disillusionment.**

>**“Who the hell wants to have a police officer put their hand on them or yell and scream at them? It’s an awful experience,”** he said. “I’ve had it multiple, multiple times. Every black man I know has had this experience. Every one of them. It is hard to believe that the world is your oyster if the police can rough you up without punishment. And **when I talked to minority youth, almost every single one of them mentions lower level uses of force as the reason why they believe the world is corrupt.**” (emphasis theirs)

There are bad people and perverts mixed in everywhere. This shouldn't be a surprise. Attack the individual if you find it necessary, but this ""Ah-ha! Liberals have pedos too!"" approach is just pathetic and not helping anything. You all know it, too. If anything, it just makes you look more like a Milo sympathizer.

Milo said what he said. He was not framed. He was not set up. He was not misunderstood. Get the fuck over it and stop defending him.

Takei had relations with an adult at a young age. That's not a good thing, but if he personally doesn't feel traumatized by it, it's not exactly *incriminating* for him to simply accept it and own it. What WOULD be wrong is if he approves of other cases of this happening the way Milo did. That was not explicitly indicated in the article.  

Edit: I'm being informed that Milo was 17 during his similar ""underage"" relationship. I don't think this really counters my point though. I'll acknowledge the error, but it doesn't change the message.

Edit 2: [I just got a message saying I am now banned from this subreddit??](http://imgur.com/a/dxkZR) I'm not sure if anyone will be able to see this edit... I was calling out a bullshit sensationalist post for what it is. Sorry if that offended anyone, I guess? 

Edit 3: A big thank you to everyone patting me on the back. I'm not sure how banning works but apparently my edits can still be seen. I asked the mod who banned why he did it, and he responded by telling me I ""don't have the right"" to call this article sensationalist garbage. Apparently /r/Conservative ISN'T as big of an advocate for free speech as it claims to be. I challenged the user, and without response, I was muted from messaging mods.

We can do better than this. This is why the country is so divided. Nobody is willing to go outside of their comfort zone and be challenged on anything, even if the opposing argument isn't coming from within your own community. Nothing I said was anti-conservative. If anything, I was trying to protect the integrity of this subreddit from putting another target on its back. I hope everyone here is paying attention to these instances of banning for petty reasons. Keep upvoting rational discussion, even if it questions conservative figured or values. Echo chambers are satisfying, but extremely dangerous. The mods need to stop indulging on that urge.

Remember kids: Just because you're allowed to say pretty much anything, doesn't preclude or exempt  you from the fact that people are going to react to it how they chose. A&E had every right to do what they did to Robertson just as he had every right to say what he wanted to say.

There are consequences in this world for everything. Remember: constitutional rights only protect interactions and contracts that an individual has with the state.  If the feds came down and said they were going to arrest Robertson because of what he said THEN we definitely should get up in arms about it, but as of now it has nothing to do with that.

Also, there is a clear and definitive judicial standard for what constitutes unprotected hate speech. The Supreme Court has embraced the idea that hate speech is permissible unless it will lead to imminent hate violence ((Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476 (1993))  ((R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul)) .

That case is awesome by the way for anyone who likes to jack-off to the first amendment. Scalia's written majority opinion is a classic, and it's a pretty funny read if you know a bit about the guy and his positions, other writings, etc.

"Every race has privileges, and every race has drawbacks. Those privileges & drawbacks are only experienced where racism is present though. No racism = no privilege or drawbacks. The reality is, we ALL make judgments about people based on something. Whether skin color, religion, age, beauty, physical fitness, fashion, wealth, fame, type of career someone has, material possessions, grammar, education, popularity, personality, etc. My personal opinion is the greatest privileges in life that we don't control are (1) our parent's connections/socio-economic status, (2a) natural beauty, (2b) natural charisma, (3) the quality of our home life (both stability & the degree to which our parents invested in nurturing & educating us), (4) our parent's wealth, (5) natural intelligence.

I grew up in a rural, upper-middle class family (started off middle class, but was upper-middle by the time I graduated HS). There was a tremendous difference in opportunity when I went to college compared to kids that grew up in connected, affluent families, and had attended prestigious college prep schools. Not only had they received a better HS education, but their parents were able to use connections to score them valuable internships, pay for study abroad programs, etc. And, when they graduated, ""family friends"" lined up to hire them. This was the case for personal friends who were white, black, Mexican, and Indian. There was no difference.

Also, I had a friend who was stunningly beautiful, but only of average intelligence (for a college grad). Yet, she landed a job with Black & Decker, where, b/c of her beauty, she was able to become the #5 sales person in the company by her 2nd year (at 24 y/o). She then parlayed that 6-figure job into an even better 6-figure pharmaceutical sales rep job. Her beauty opened a lot of doors that would not have been opened if she'd been fat or ugly.

It seems like natural intelligence opens the first door. If you come from money, that opens the second door. If you had a great home life, with parents that invested in you, that opens the third door. If you happen to have natural beauty or natural charisma, that opens the 4th door VERY wide. And if you have parents that have a strong network of connections/influence, that opens the 5th door. I am now fairly wealthy by US standards (net wealth of $3.1M). But, I'm very much ""middle class"" when it comes to connections. There are doors that people with far less money can open that I can't, simply b/c they come from highly connected families. Those are privileges that have far greater value, b/c they are applicable at all times, not simply when dealing with racists. The Obama girls, as well as the daughters of all black politicians & social elites, shows that skin color is not the limitation that some make it out to be. That's not to say that there aren't benefits from being white, but they aren't remotely as powerful as other privileges.",conservative

"I guess if you have an article in Breitbart you have to use a lot of **bold** and CAPS. Rand does need to communicate in a more conversational, regular guy manner if he ever wants to be elected President so maybe it's good practice.

Republicans' message on health care has always been terrible. They have no clear message. Democrats want everyone to have great health insurance. If it's hard to afford, the government will provide it for them. You may disagree, but at least you understand their plan.

Republican healthcare plans are such a mishmash. Buying across state lines sounds nice, but are people going to march through the streets for it like progressives do for government-run healthcare?

Those of us that care about freedom really need to start advocating for a revolution in healthcare.

The reason healthcare is too damn expensive is because of all the red tape and lack of transparency. Patients have no idea what anything costs because costs are hidden.

Every American should be able to go on a website that has 3rd party reviews of every hospital and doctor and lists prices for each treatment and doctor visit. If patients could decided where to get their healthcare based on price and quality, both price and quality would improve, just like TVs, smart phones, super markets, and yes, lasik, contact lenses, and braces.

Trump won these three states by 20 points combined

"Great video. 

I have a small anecdote to contribute: one of my parents used to work with a prominent biochemist, and he was black. He started an affirmative action program to bring in black high school students to work in his lab so they would get work experience and perhaps foster a love of science. He had one girl who was particularly bright who surprisingly dropped out of the program. He was quite struck at this, and he asked her why. She dropped out because her friends told her that she began ""talking white"". 

When people throw up their hands, like the BLM lady in this video did, at the mention of a culture problem ask them  how white people are responsible for the notion of ""talking white"" within the black community. 

Just as the lady on the right mentioned, when cultural approval/capital is tied to destructive and anti-social behavior, that's a culture problem. You become more Mexican if you go to jail. You become less black if you're articulate. You gain social capital in the Jewish and Asian-American communities for getting into elite colleges and becoming elite professionals. The BLM lady wants us to believe there isn't a culture problem?

There isn't some finite amount of bravery in the world.  Praise to one individual doesn't take anything away from another.  If a news outlet or an individual praises Jenner for her actions, it is not an indictment against soldiers, cops and firefighters.  

The attitude is about as helpful as commenting on the bravery of an Iraq war veteran to say that the hardship and danger they faced was nothing compared to what the WW2 vets faced.  

I'm certainly not trying to compare Jenner to a soldier.  We use bravery in a variety of contexts.  Someone facing terminal illness with dignity and strength is often said to be brave, and I doubt many here would disrespect that characterization by making comparisons to decorated war veterans.

If the poorer guy isn't gifted enough to grab those scholarships (and we'll say the wealthier guy isn't gifted enough either, fwiw), the wealthier guy will come out ahead because he can go to school anyway.

It's not ""fair"", but that's not what equality is about. Equality (from a true conservative POV) is about recognizing the innate dignity of personhood and fairly protecting each and every person's rights under law. If you truly want equality of chance, the only way to enforce it is in a similar vein to a totalitarian, communist society.

I mean, equality of outcome in one generation begets equality of chance in the next; unless you're willing to truly level the playing field by removing economic, environmental, and cultural influences on the young (which you'd have to do by making incomes the same, to start, which, hey, that sounds dangerously close to communism to me) you'll never have either. Frankly, you're not supposed to. It's not about making sure there's a truly equal chance for every individual to have the same success as each other individual, that's silly and impossible.

All equality is about (from a true conservative POV) is the government ensuring that the less-advantaged don't have fewer rights than the more-advantaged just because they don't have the same advantages. It's not about compensating for those advantages/disadvantages through legislation (which the left is all for), nor is it about ensuring truly equal opportunity for every individual, which is impossible as I mentioned before.

Are these allegations true? We don’t know yet, but if any part of them are than Obama and/or his officials could face serious trouble.

"There were more white slaves in the Ottoman empire than there were black slaves in the US, slavery was legal almost 10 years longer than in the US and it was still practiced afterwards until about the 1920s with little to no repercussions from authorities, but people feel uncomfortable talking about it because it doesn't fit their narrative about how only white people have ever committed atrocities. And that's already ignoring the fact that most African slaves were sold by their fellow Africans and that only a tiny minority was directly captured by slave traders. 

I actually once dared to bring this up in a thread about slavery (some dude saying that white people should get enslaved for a few generations to better understand the struggles of minorities) in r/blackpeopletwitter and after being called every insult in the book and was told multiple times that white people deserved it and/or that I'm trying to take away attention from the problems of African Americans (fun fact: My parents are Moroccan, but hey) the mods decided to remove my comments for ""trolling"" because apparently there's only room for an artificial truth, not reality.

That election wasn't tainted by having no confidence in the electoral process, but by having two milquetoast candidates that nobody could choose between so the result was an almost completely even split.

On the other hand, Trump is saying he might not accept the will of the voters *before a single vote has been tallied*, which is the same as saying that he might have gone third party and eviscerated the Republican party's base if he hadn't gotten the Republican nomination (a tactic that worked very well to bully anti-Trump conservatives into supporting him, if you'll remember). 

It does nothing to bolster confidence in the American electoral process and in fact lays seeds of doubt that may end up creating more factions of homegrown American dissidents and anarchists who now have a major public figure saying ""don't trust your leaders, they've stolen your country. Take your public elected officials out of office by any means necessary, since the only legal means is now illegitimate."" #draintheswamp might as well mean #guillotinethearistocracy with the amount of class conflict, nationalistic fervor, and disaffection with official government transferral of power that Trump is trumpeting.

Look at all the facts we know about the Orlando shooter and ask why more isn't being done about the obvious radical Islamic red flags, and why Gun Control is the only topic the left wants to discuss: 

* [One gun store](http://www.wsj.com/articles/orlando-shooter-turned-away-from-gun-store-owner-says-1466024932) refused to sell ammunition or body armor to the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, a few weeks ago because he was acting suspicious.  No one was notified.  

* Disney security [notified authorities back in April](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/06/14/wow-disney-warned-fbi-about-omar-mateen-back-in-april-n2178406) about Omar Mateen because they believed he was canvasing the theme park.  

* The [FBI interviewed](http://news.wgbh.org/2016/06/13/orlando-shooter-was-interviewed-twice-fbi-and-could-still-buy-gun) Mateen more than once for more than one suspected radical Islamic connection.  Mateen wasn't on any watch lists as of the Orlando shooting.  

* The Orlando shooter, Mateen, made multiple trips to Saudi Arabia (obviously by itself not a red flag).

* The Shooter's father is a well known pro-Taliban supporter, and Afghanistan-US immigrant.  ""[In a June 11 video](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-father-idUSKCN0YY109) posted on Facebook, Mateen [the father] is dressed in military fatigues and says Afghanistan must ""punish the traitors.""  He's referring to the current Afghanistan Government,  the one the Taliban is fighting against.  

* [Omar Mateen was a troubled youth, and violent](http://cbs12.com/news/local/former-teacher-of-omar-mateen-feared-he-would-cause-harm).  His Father, again an Afghanistan-US immigrant, apparently didn't cooperate with school teachers, going so far as to tell his son not to listen to women.

 “In a much quoted passage in his inaugural address, President Kennedy said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.’  It is a striking sign of the temper of our times that the controversy about this passage centered on its origin and not its content.  Neither half of the statement expresses a relation between the citizen and his government that is worthy of the ideals of free men in a free society.”

“The paternalistic “what your country can do for you” implies that government is the patron – the citizen, the ward, a view that is at odds with the free man’s belief in his own responsibility for his own destiny.  The organismic, “what you can do for your country” implies that government is the master or diety – the citizen, the servant or votary.” 

“To the free man, the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, not over and above them. He is proud of the common heritage and loyal to common traditions, but regards government as a means, an instrumentality – neither a grantor of favors and gifts, nor a master or god to be blindly worshipped and served.  He recognizes no national goal except as it is the consensus of the goals that the citizens severally serve.  He recognizes no national purpose except as it is the consensus of the purposes for which the citizens severally strive.”

“The free man will ask neither what his country can do for him nor what he can do for his country. He will ask rather “What can I and my compatriots do through government” to help us achieve our several goals and purposes, and above all, to protect our freedom?” 

“And he will accompany this question with another: “How can we keep the government we create from becoming a ‘Frankenstein’ that will destroy the very freedom we establish it to protect?“",conservative

2. The ruling was that Davis had suffered 3 strikes during her filibuster and therefore the Senate could consider a motion to end the filibuster. These strikes were related to germaneness (strike 1), receiving assistance (strike 2), germaneness (strike 3). However, if you read the actual rules, it says the following: 

>>Raising of a third point of order against further debate by a Senator on the floor who has **digressed for a third time** from a discussion of the pending amendment, after having been twice requested to confine his debate to the amendment, justifies the presiding officer in calling for a vote by the Senate on the question of whether or not he shall be permitted to resume and continue his remarks (50 S.J. Reg. 418 (1947)). [link](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/Rules/82-0/82_Senate_Rules.pdf)

3. While Senator Watson was debating whether the filibuster should be allowed to continue (he had the floor because the presiding officer accidentally recognized him first), a Republican senator butted in and moved to end the debate. This is clearly against the rules because Sen. Watson had the floor and did not yield, but the presiding officer completely ignored him and recognized the Republican Senator.

Tell those who have successfully defending themselves, their homes, their families, their property that the gun they used gives them a false sense of security.

>  I live in Northbrook, where criminal danger is remote. My boys laugh at us for locking the doors. 

So, in one paragraph you chastise those you use a gun for protection and then admit that you live in a rather crime free area.  Fuck you.

> I told her I assume they wouldn’t sell me a gun because I’m a reporter. She denied it. But hating the media is right behind hating the government as a pastime for many gun owners. They damn you for being ignorant then hide when you try to find out.

I am a gun owner and I hate the media for their constant anti-gun and anti-second amendment bullshit.  You're the reason I don't trust the media.  As for the government, we have a woman running for President who committed crimes under investigation by the FBI.  She should be indicted, but the current President is actively protecting her.  Now, explain to me how I am wrong about not trusting the government.

>A few hours later, Maxon sent the newspaper a lengthy statement, the key part being: “it was uncovered that Mr. Steinberg has an admitted history of alcohol abuse, and a charge for domestic battery involving his wife.”
>Well, didn’t see that coming. Were that same standard applied to the American public, there would be a whole lot fewer guns sold. Beside, they knew I planned to immediately sell it back to them.

Okay, jackass, that is the standard applied to the American public.  You were not treated special because of your job.  You think the gun store owners want to deny you business because you are a journalist?  Think about it for a moment, they knew what you did and knew what you were up to, had you been sold the gun because you were doing an article and were going to sell it back the next day you'd tear them a new one in your article about how they did that because you failed your background check.  Since you failed that check they couldn't sell it to you anyways.  Too bad your attempt at a smear piece failed.  Try doing some honest journalism.

> Now I’ll state what I believe the real reason is: Gun manufacturers and the stores that sell them make their money in the dark.

No...you dense mother fucker, you failed your background check.  

>Would-be terrorists can buy guns. Insane people can buy guns. But reporters . . . that’s a different story. 

Those terrorist and insane people bought their guns legally.  If there is no reported reason why person A shouldn't be allowed to buy a gun then person A will be sold a gun. Our justice system is not capable to predict who will and will not commit a crime.  You failed your back ground check.  Not because of your job, but because of that domestic violence charge.  You are the very person you're wanting to not be able to buy a gun.

"Here are a few reasons you NEED to go out and vote:

* Polls are historically quite bad at predicting elections when a point or two separate the candidates. 

* Most polls are showing a D+3 to D+11 skew towards Democrats. This would indicate a higher Dem showout than in 2008. This isn't going to happen and thus we have a very good reason to believe the polls are wrong.

* If the polls are wrong, Nate Silver is wrong.

* Romney is consistently drawing larger crowds than Obama. 

* Forget what the media says: even seasoned political scientists can't call this one. It is truly a neck and neck race.

* The fundamentals are very good for Romney. Early voting suggests a large untapped groundswell of Republican support that will show up at the polls tomorrow.

* My own analysis predicts a solid Romney win in CO. 70% of the early vote is in and the party affiliations show a 3 point lead to Romney. If this holds up (and statistical regression strongly supports this) then it will be much easier for Romney to win.

* Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the meltdown on /r/politics will be glorious to behold.

"It's hip to be a victim in our country.  To be 'bullied' is to be oppressed and there's nothing the media likes more than to find victims (particularly of minority status) to showcase as a recipient of oppression (typically handed out by white, male, Christian Americans).  It's a symbiotic relationship whereby the media gets to sell more advertising, push an agenda and the victim gets attention and sympathy from self-serving p.c. warriors.  

The temptation to indulge in narcissism is so powerful that oftentimes these folks will fabricate the story and a willing media will purposely not investigate for fear of their narrative crumbling.  When caught in the lie the 'victim' will justify the means because while false, the story sheds light on this purported discrimination.  That or it was just a form of 'performance art'.

The examples are abound and the influx of these stories has yet to even reach critical mass.  ",conservative
"The Left is so caught up in victimhood status as something to be admired and adored that they actually have to make up episodes of being victims when we Conservatives aren't actually as evil as they portray us. Here are just some examples:

Duke Lacrosse Rape Case - Black stripper accuses white Duke Lacrosse players of raping her at a party. Her story is found to be another complete fabrication.

Madonna Constantine - Black Columbia professor ""found"" a noose around her door one morning as an apparent racist statement. Grand jury is convened to investigate. Columbia initially refuses to give security camera evidence over to cops, reverses their decisions but camera footage is never released to the public. Case is discretely closed with no charges filed. It is most likely Constantine put the noose there herself.

Meg Lanker-Simons - University of Wyoming student and feminist points out anonymous Facebook post threatening her rape, inciting protests. An investigation reveals that the threat came from her own computer. 

Oberlin college - Anti-Jew, racist and anti-gay graffiti messages are found around campus. The culprits? Dylan Bleiber and Matt Alden, both Obama supporters and self-described Democrats and Leftists.

"Ben, thank you for taking the time to do an AMA.

Many of the #NeverTrump people believe Trump is a liberal because he has said liberal things in the past, and for that reason refuse to vote for him.

However, Romney basically wrote Obama-care, flip flopped on abortion, changed his position on climate change, signed an assault weapons ban, supported the bailout, etc, yet there was never a ""NeverRomney"" movement from the conservatives.

Instead, Glenn Beck, Redstate, Levin, and most of the NeverTrump people actually voted for Romney -- despite of his previous liberal positions. Can you explain the perceived discrepancy?",conservative
"Ben, thank you for doing this AMA. How would you respond to your [2011 Town Hall article] (http://www.townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2011/04/13/the_magic_of_donald_trump) praising ""The Magic of Donald Trump""? 

In this article, you lauded his ability to steamroll the media, self fund, and pull on union support among other things. You called him the best Republican candidate out there. 

How would you respond in light of your disparaging remarks about him through the primary season given that all of the same traits you once lauded propelled him to the Republican nomination you once sought for him?",conservative

"What would you say to Trump voters such as myself?  I voted for Bush, but stopped participating after Obama won the election.  I'm in California, where the leftism has been allowed to run rampant and has destroyed the State.  Our last gasp of air was Prop. 187, nearly 20 years ago.

How can you justify risking another 4 years of leftist rule to someone like me, who sees issues like immigration as THE most destructive force against conservatism?

Isn't something better than nothing?

How do you justify the ""no true Scotsman"" outlook, when the consequences are so great?",conservative
"Ben, 

My question for you is about healthcare. I'm a medical student, and I struggle to look at healthcare through a free market lens. It seems to me that healthcare can't be a free market, since part of being a in free market implies voluntary participation and the ability to boycott or put economic leverage on a supplier. 

This is a problem for the healthcare market. If I want to buy a boat this year but the new model is too expensive, I can wait a couple of years for the price to come down, or go online and buy from a better dealer... but I can't just wait or properly shop around for emergency or life saving treatment (e.g. chemo). Especially if someone is incredibly poor, there isn't a low end or old model chemo they can pick up to get treated. 

I guess my question is, ***can healthcare truly function and be fixed by the free market alone?*** If not, how much room is there for government to help out (e.g. how big should Medicaid be, is socialized medicine an awful idea, etc)?

Thanks for your time and for doing this AMA!",conservative

"Ben, is the rift with Milo Yiannopoulos as serious as it seems, or are you two just colleagues in disagreement? Huge fan of the show by the way. I'm supporting Trump this election cycle because I refuse to allow Cuckold Clinton in the white house, but, I will not stop listening just because you are anti-trump as I believe only leftists would shut out opinions they disagree with.

"My fellow 20 somethings are conservatives in how they operate their own lives yet refuse to apply that ideology more generally and politically. I think it stems from the GOP being stigmatized by social issue culture wars. Even young conservatives are more likely to identify as libertarians because of it.
How is the GOP (if it survives) going to combat that ingrained perception with the newly added frustration of Trumpism association? Or is Libertarianism the only recourse?",conservative

since when was the criteria for winning a debate judged on how ""stylish"" you were or how you interrupted the other person fewer times? i thought the point of a debate was to convince other people to take your side by explaining the reasoning behind your stances.

i thought winning meant your points made more sense and that your points were explained well. i must have missed the memo here

"Some of these comments show why the right cannot buck the image that it's a white's only boys club. Some introspection would say here is more than a grain of truth to it. Is it obvious that she was chosen because of her race and gender. That being said its not like they are putting Beyoncé on it. This is a legitimately important figure in American history. If I was a black or gay or female fiscal conservative and I read this shit, I wouldn't feel welcome on the right. Personally I don't give a fuck what someone looks like or who they are attracted to. My criteria is simple: Do you produce more than you take for society? If you do, come on in, we want you. If you want to argue Harriet Tubman took more from American than she gave, then make a legit argument. Until then, what exactly is your point? No one who is black or female should ever be on currency? Currency is somehow frozen and time and should never be changed? Or is it simple, you don't like blacks or women or both. ",conservative
