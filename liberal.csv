">~~Donald Trump~~ The Republican Party has no political philosophy beyond pissing off liberals

FTFY.

Trump just makes it more obvious, like everything else he says the soft parts loud. But the Republicans have basically been nothing more or less than the anti-Democrats since at least the 1990's.

Hell, the terrorist attack of 9/11 was successful mostly because of that. Bill Clinton thought Al Qaeda was a big deal,  the Republicans mocked him for this, remember all that ""wag the dog"" bullshit they spewed? They insisted that Al Qaeda was nothing important, and Bill's focus on it was just a pathetic attempt to distract America from the **REAL** important issue: his blowjobs.

Junior came into office with no plan or intent beyond being the anti-Clinton. Since Bill Clinton thought Al Qaeda was a big deal, Junior decided Al Qaeda was utterly irrelevant. So much so that when the CIA tried to warn him, with a memo titled ""Bin Laden determined to strike US"", he said ""Ok you've covered your ass"" and told them to stop bothering him.

So yeah, Trump has no political philosophy beyond pissing off liberals, and he defines ""liberal"" as ""anyone who disagrees with me on any topic at all"". But that's not unique to Trump, that's just Republicans. All Republicans.",liberal

"Keep in mind that this is all based on Session's own words.

>FRANKEN: ... These documents also allegedly say “there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.” Again, I’m telling you this as it’s coming out, so, you know.

>But if it's true, it’s obviously extremely serious, and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?

>SESSIONS: Senator Franken, I’m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.

Franken didn't ask if anyone affiliated with the campaign communicated with the Russians *about campaign business* (which is what the Republican establishment is now trying to defend against). He asked is anyone affiliated with the campaign communicated with the Russians during the campaign. ""In the course of the campaign"" means during the course of the campaign, it does not mean about the campaign like the Republican establishment is trying to spin it. It was during the time period where Sessions was acting as a policy adviser for the Trump campaign that he met with Kislyak, whether or not he discussed campaign business with him.

Now they're admitting that he did have communications with the Russians during the course of the campaign but saying that he didn't mention the meetings while asked about it under oath because they didn't talk about the campaign. A (possibly but at least believably) true answer would have been ""Yes, I've communicated with the Russian government as part of my duties as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee but we did not discuss the Trump campaign"" or even just adding ""I did not have communications with the Russians *about the campaign*"" but instead he lied about it and said that he'd had no communication with them.

""1) Myth: The minimum wage was never supposed to be a living wage

This is probably one of the most dangerous—and easy to debunk—myths about the minimum wage, which was championed by Franklin D. Roosevelt beginning in 1933. During an address FDR gave about one of his many economic salvation packages, he explained that “no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.”

At the time, Roosevelt’s Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938—passed as part of New Deal legislation—set minimum wage at 25 cents. Roosevelt intended this rate to be “more than a bare subsistence level.” The minimum wage was created expressly to ensure that people of all skill-levels, if they worked, could “earn a decent living” off those wages—thus, a living wage.""

http://www.salon.com/2015/08/04/the_7_most_dangerous_myths_about_the_fight_for_a_15_minimum_wage_partner/


""Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968 at $8.68 (in 2016 dollars). Since it was last raised in 2009, to the current $7.25 per hour, the federal minimum has lost about 9.6% of its purchasing power to inflation. Back in 2015, The Economist estimated that, given how rich the U.S. is and the pattern among other advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, “one would expect America … to pay a minimum wage around $12 an hour.”

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/

' Of course, if the commenter, himself, had “read history,” he would see that, in fact, the minimum wage was always supposed to be a living wage. In fact, to argue that the minimum wage was never supposed to be a living wage is completely anachronistic.
In his 1933 address following the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted that “no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.” '

The economy is little more than money going in a circle, and there's little substantial difference between that money going through private companies or going through government entities.

And what's typically called, 'government waste' is usually paying the salary of middle class people.  It's not like government money evaporates into thin air - it gets funneled to the private sector and funds jobs.

When the government pays for services, it pays the salary of those performing the services, and it's not like a company is going to magically replace those services unless it's paid enough to profit from the task - which is going to 'cost' taxpayers a similar amount.

So cutting off the government completely is the same as deleting a portion of the economy, but with nothing to replace it.  When you halt the circle of money, it has drastic effects.

And as an aside, this guy may be the greatest writer who ever lived, with how he spun Trump.

I'm glad he came out with this, but I fear it may have been too late. 

I also think this bit was interesting, and perhaps telling:

>Schwartz expected Trump to attack him for speaking out, and he was correct. Informed that Schwartz had made critical remarks about him, and wouldn’t be voting for him, Trump said, “He’s probably just doing it for the publicity.” He also said, “Wow. That’s great disloyalty, because I made Tony rich. He owes a lot to me. I helped him when he didn’t have two cents in his pocket. It’s great disloyalty. I guess he thinks it’s good for him—but he’ll find out it’s not good for him.”

Interesting that Trump assumes it must be for personal gain, and not because this guy genuinely feels guilty and concerned that he painted a positive picture of Trump that boosted his legend, to the point where he could be at the head of one of the world's most powerful nations. 

If what this author is saying is true, and Trump has *any* level of self-awareness, it should be obvious to him that Schwartz could be genuine. Unless, of course, thinking in any other terms than ""personal gain"" is a completely alien concept to the man...

"Arthur Laffer is Gov. Brownback's chief economic advisor.

His theory has never panned out-ever.

There is an urban legend to the effect that it worked when Reagan tried it.  When Reagan saw the looming deficits, he pulled the plug on the next phase.

We all know the theory ; tax cuts for the ""job creators"" makes them run out and buy factories, thereby creating an economic boom and generating more tax revenue than before the cuts.

In point of fact, the opposite happens; the rich generally keep the money in the bank.

However, when the poor get a tax cut, they are the ones who directly stimulate the local economy by spending they money on things they need but have been doing without.  Things like diapers and more/better food.

I'm sure some people would run out and buy an eight ball as well.

The right does an excellent job of renaming things that become part of the vernacular, to the detriment of the little guy every single time:

Forget the ""inheritance tax"", which ONLY affects that part of intergenerational family assets in excess of $5.4 million.

What percentage of our population will ever stand to inherit that kind of money?

Does anybody know?  I don't, but I guess I will look into it.  I think the number is vanishingly small.

But call it a ""death tax"" and suddenly it becomes yet another symbol of government overreach, and every right leaning American wants it gone, even though doing away with it is very much against their interests.

"When are people going to get over this Impeach Trump nonsense? As much as I despise Trump and would love to see him gone it's not going to happen. 

First, the Republican party is not going to impeach one of their own. No President has ever been impeached by their own party when that party is in the majority in Congress. Any attempt by Republicans to impeach Trump would result in the splintering of the party into warring factions, and that is the last thing the Republicans want. 

And if Trump were impeached the result would be no better. Pence or Ryan are not any better than Trump. So what do we gain by impeaching Trump? Do you really think Pence would be better than Trump? Pence is a religatard that would try to convert the US into his version of the Christian Taliban. Not a place most rational people would want to live. 

Instead of wasting time and energy on impeaching Trump we need to use that energy trying to force division in the Republican party. Keep them fighting amongst themselves so they cannot get any of their goals accomplished. Keep them occupied in the courts trying to defend their unconstitutional proposals. 

We need to put our heads together and come up with creative ways to oppose the Republicans agenda. Want to have some fun opposing the Republicans? Contact the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and other organizations. Tell them you would like to start a pledge drive. What's that? Well it works like this. Instead of attending the White House correspondents dinner like every other President has done Trump the Special Snowflake is creating a Safe Place for him and his other Special Snowflakes to hide away from the rational people that oppose him. He's having another Trump Rally. Get ahold of the ACLU or Planned Parenthood and urge them to have a pledge drive where everyone pledges to donate $1 (Or whatever amount they can afford) for every minute Trump speaks. Trump speaks for 30 minutes, you donate $30 bucks to your charity that opposes Trump. And the ACLU can setup a Tote Board that keeps a running total of the amount of money pledged that is updated live. And make sure Trump and his supporters can see exactly how much money his speech is raising to oppose him and his ideas. Keep talking Mr. Trump, the longer you speak the more money you raise for the ACLU!!!!

2. He won't leave the United States.  He won't go anywhere he could risk getting arrested.
3. The United States will not honor anything the ICC says, even if they call for his arrest.  We are one of a handful of countries that has flatly said we don't want to be part of the ICC and refuse to recognize it's authority.

---

Mitt Romney is a serial Hair Splitter and semantics parser.

His Tax Plan DOES work in the ways he says, because he parses the differences between ""Income"" and ""Revenue"" in a technical way, while at the same time using the colloquial term ""income"" to suggest revenue.

When he talks about people making less than $200,000 paying no taxes on Capital Gain and investments, he's talking about less than $200,000 in INCOME the way the IRS defines income, but he's OK if the uninformed think he's using Income colloquially as ""net receipts - (including capital gains and such) when he's actually talking about a very specific type of self-employed corporate/person hybrid who actually brings in most of their money from Capital Gains and then pays themselves a Taxable Income (salary) of less than $200,000.

So he's not really talking about lowering YOUR taxes (although if you are in a position to pay yourself this way, your taxes may go down too), he's talking about people like himself getting NO TAXES on all but $200,000 of their corporate personhood's [colloquial] income that it pays itself as a salary.

This argument about Government creating jobs is the same story.

He'll probably tell you ""Government doesn't create jobs, but it can foster an environment where businesses can hire more workers"".

But truthfully, businesses don't ""create jobs"" any more than the Government does.

DEMAND creates jobs.

Businesses may hire workers to fill that demand.

Government may do things to foster an environment that creates demand for a product, that businesses can then exploit to hire workers to fill that demand.

But Mitt doesn't ever talk about that part of his assertion that Government doesn't create jobs. He's happy if his supporters believe he agrees with whatever they think about it and continue to worship ""job creators"" like himself...

It also seems like often when he talks about how many jobs he could create, he never really specifies WHERE these jobs will be.

He doesn't say he could create 12million American jobs. 10million of those jobs he promises to create might be in China if he's not specifying that they are American jobs in the exact sentence he's uttering.

It's sleazy used car salesman tactics at their worst.

"Nothing new to see here. The only thing that still blows my mind about Fox News is that there is a sect of people who really are ignorant enough to think it is ""fair and balanced"" when it couldn't be further from the truth.

And then there are the constant cries about how MSNBC is the 'liberal' version of Fox (which also couldn't be more wrong) and the fact that all other sources aside from Fox have a 'liberal bias.' 

So yeah…Fox News is paid for and owned by rich people who are pushing an agenda that is going to help them out specifically and exclusively. Uneducated people are dumb enough to buy into it and allow themselves to get emotionally charged, angry and paranoid.

In a more decent civilization, Fox News would be held responsible for the problems they've perpetuated and caused. I'm not for censorship, but ultimately the problem is that those certain Americans are dumb enough to watch and believe.

In an educated/informed nation, Fox News would be laughed off the air and I don't believe that's an exaggeration. 

In the end, the real problem is that as Fox News continues, it gets more and more incendiary, more and more extreme and more and more influential on the lowest common denominator. They bang the drums for war, the line up the least educated in America and warn them to take up arms, tell them lies and tell them what they want to hear to allow them to feel that their racism, xenophobia, misogyny and bigotry and hate are all warranted. 

That is literally the only cause they serve. Their viewership has continued to shrink and will continue to as these people die off. Young people have no interest in the lies and bullshit.

Get rid of anything that protects you from being exploited. Unions, regulations, the EPA, OSHA, bill of rights, voter rights act, and so on are all in the crosshairs to one degree or another.

Get rid of anything that benefits you. Their CEOs? Plenty of swag and freebies, first class everything, expense accounts, whatever they want. You? They want to end your benefits, assistance, social programs, mass transit, public education, medicare, social security, welfare and so on.

Privatize everything. Now you can get social security, education etc but in their for-profit privatized system. By the way, I guess when they take it over it will already start with 600 billion of your tax dollars, of course. They see dollar signs -and nothing else.

Tax you, not them. Flat taxes, 999 plans, trickle down, tax cuts for the rich, blah blah blah. It all pans out to YOU pay for THEM to do everything they want (remember, you don't deserve ""entitlements"" but they get to use your taxes as they see fit) and they pay for squat.

But beyond that, when the brain and heart start to form, there's no doubting we're talking about a living human being, albeit one completely incapable of surviving outside of the uterus for very many months to come.  

These rabid antiabortionists have some really messed up ideas on telling a woman what to do with her own body, and downright illogical and inhuman attitudes on how women who are not ready to have a child should be treated.  But people who get multiple abortions really need to stop using them as if they're just another form of contraception - even if it's just for their own health.  It really isn't a good idea to repeatedly put your body through such rigours.

'This is not the right time for me' should be reason enough to have ONE abortion.  But demanding the right to abort on-demand, with no limit on how many abortions you can expect to have, is no different from demanding the right to be irresponsible, and dressing it up in the language of 'women's rights' - which were hard enough to win in the first place - as if you have some overarching right to ignore basic matters of fact just because you can't keep your legs shut.

[The Facts On O'Reillys So-Called Working Class Background](http://www.oreilly-sucks.com/oreillyinfo/spinfacts01.html)

""It's a familiar O'Reilly refrain, peppered throughout his book and salted into conversation. O'Reilly practically fetishizes his ""working-class background."" He grew up, he often says, in Levittown, N.Y., the famed postwar tract suburb on Long Island. He recalls a childhood of secondhand cars, a small home with one bathroom, summer vacations to Miami aboard a Greyhound bus, a father ""who never earned more than $35,000 a year in his life."" He frequently tells the story of how, in high school, the better-off kids scorned him for his ""two sports coats,"" bought at the unfashionable Modell's. Even today, O'Reilly says, he drives a used car.""

[...]

""The only reason Bill O'Reilly thought he was working class, is the fact that he went to a private school where all the other kids parents were multi-millionaires. So he thought he was working class, compared to the other kids parents at his private school. Kids of working class parents don't get to go to private schools either, they go to public schools on the yellow public school bus.""



""O'Reilly actually grew up in Westbury, Long Island, according to his mother Angela, who still lives in the Levitt-built house Bill grew up in. Westbury Long Island is a ""middle-class suburb a few miles from Levittown,"" where he attended a private school (Washington Post, 12/13/00). His late father, William O'Reilly Sr., was a currency accountant with Caltex, an oil company; Angela ""Ann"" O'Reilly was a homemaker who also worked as a physical therapist.""

""While hardly well off, the O'Reillys - Mom, Dad, Bill Jr. and his younger sister, Janet - weren't exactly deprived, either. Both children attended private school, and the family sent Bill to Marist College, a private college in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., as well as the University of London for a year, without financial aid btw.""

""O'Reilly's father was a frugal man and a wise investor. His son acknowledges in his book that his father bequeathed ""a very nice chunk of change"" to his mother upon his death in 1986. As for Dad never earning more than $35,000, what O'Reilly doesn't mention is that Dad retired in 1978, when a $35,000 income was the equivalent of $92,000 in today's dollars.""

Until Biden gives the oath to the incoming Senators,  the Senate will consist of 34 Dems,  2 Independents in Bernie and Angus King who caucus with the Dems,  and 30 Republicans.

But I am by no means a Con Law Scholar.  

Seriously,  the chances of this are pretty much zero,  but part of me would love to see it happen.

Dear Red States... 

We've decided we're leaving. We intend to form our own country ... from all the Blue States. 

In case you aren't aware, that includes Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nevada, New Mexico, Michigan, Illinois and all the Northeast. We believe this split will be beneficial to the nation ... at least the new one. 

To sum up briefly: You get Texas, Oklahoma and all the slave states and the flyover tornado states. 

We get stem cell research and the best beaches. You get ... corn, soybeans and tobacco.

We get the Statue of Liberty. You get Dollywood. 

We get Intel and Microsoft. You get ... CNN and Fox. 

We get 85 percent of America's venture capital and entrepreneurs. You get Alabama. 

We get two-thirds of the tax revenue; you get to make due with the states that take more in federal spending than they pay in taxes. 

Since our aggregate divorce rate is 22 percent lower than the Christian Coalition's, we get a bunch of happy families. You get a bunch of single moms. 

Our new country will be pro-choice and anti-war, and we're going to want all our citizens back from all foreign wars at once. If you need people to fight, ask your evangelicals. They have kids they're apparently willing to send to their deaths for no purpose, and they don't care if you don't show pictures of their children's caskets coming home. We do wish you success overseas, and hope that you can win over the hearts and minds of the people by bombing them. 

We will have control of 80 percent of the country's fresh water, more than 90 percent of the pineapple and lettuce, 92 percent of the nation's fresh fruit, 95 percent of America's quality wines, 90 percent of all cheese, 90 percent of the high tech industry, most of the U.S. low-sulfur coal, all living redwoods, sequoias and condors, all the Ivy and Seven Sister schools, plus Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Cal Tech and MIT. 

In the Red States, you will have to cope with 88 percent of all obese Americans (and their projected health care costs), 92 percent of all U.S. mosquitoes, nearly 100 percent of the tornadoes, 90 percent of the hurricanes, 99 percent of all Southern Baptists, virtually 100 percent of all televangelists, Rush Limbaugh, Bob Jones University, Clemson and the University of Georgia. 

We get Hollywood, Yosemite, Las Vegas, San Diego, Seattle, Chicago, New York City and the beaches of Hawaii ... thank you. Oh, and universal healthcare provided by the government. You get ... Alaska, Texas and Florida and ... Stuckey's.

We get the states with the highest rates of college graduates, highest incomes; the states where women's rights to decide what to do with their own bodies are respected; the states with the lowest rates of circumcision, molestation and rape.

You get the states in which 38 percent of the people believe Jonah was really swallowed by a whale, 62 percent believe life is sacred unless we're discussing the death penalty or gun laws, 44 percent say that evolution is only a theory that has not been proven, and 53 percent believe Saddam was involved in 9/11. But you will be OK because 61 percent of you believe you are have superior moral values. 

Oh, and Florida and Colorado are trying to decide if they want to come along with us. And all of your cities have also petitioned us to come along, because they are also blue and don't want to have to be stuck with you red counties in all the red states. We will have to work something out. Maybe dice you up like another Berlin.

"That is one of the things that has irked me for a long time. Since 1980 the conservative movement has worked - with great success - to denigrate the word ""liberal"". For over thirty years they've thrown the phrase around as an epithet. They have sneered at anything that didn't have the fuckin' stamp of approval from the rock throwing, club waving cavemen that have infested the GOP for 30 Fucking Years.

I have been a proud (classic) liberal all of my life. I believe that there is a place for a strong government in a republic. That place is to look out for the little guy - the guy that doesn't have a voice; the guy that doesn't have the millions (now billions) of dollars required to pay his way into the chambers of power. 

The purpose of government in a republic is to ensure that our environment is protected against the abuses of powerful corporations who see the accrual of capital as an overarching goal worthy of despoiling our air and our water. 

The purpose of government is to set tariff, labor, and tax policies in such a way as to beneficial to as many people as possible, not merely the people on top of the economic heap.

The purpose of government is to ensure that our medications and our food are safe. That our borders are secure. That we aren't driven like mules in harness until such time as we are simply worn out and then cast aside like a broken tool.

I'd like to see the term ""Liberal"" recaptured by someone on the left. I'd like to see one politician stand up, say (with conviction) ""Yes, I am a liberal. That means that I don't simply look the other way when you are bankrupted because your mother had a stroke, or your kid turns up with leukemia.""
